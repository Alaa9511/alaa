Tasks required to develop the Lavish product link analysis tool
Please carefully implement the following modifications to the current project in Replit:

üü¢ First: SEO product description (Meta Description)
A final product description should be generated that does not exceed 160 characters.

It should consist of:

A real brief description of the product (taken from the link page).

Ready-made marketing words such as:

"Add to cart", "discount", "shopping", "offers", "favorable prices", "cheapest perfumes"...

Technical words associated with perfumes such as:

"Two smells", "high persistence", "oriental fragrance", "niche", "EDP", "top notes"...

An example of the desired result:

Copy
Edit
V Orchid perfume by lavish-two scents and a lasting hold. Shop now with discounts and Special Offers, add to the basket and enjoy a high quality oriental fragrance.
ÿ´ÿßŸÜŸäÿß second: a reanalysis button for the same link
A custom button should be added as:
üîÅ Reanalysis of the product

When pressed, the application regenerates the results with new words each time but they remain related to the content of the product itself.

This is done by randomly shuffling the suggested words from the list for each new attempt.

üè∑Ô∏è Third: product title SEO Title
You must generate a professional title for the product page (SEO Title) and include:

The real product name is as it is on the link page.

A clear marketing description such as:
"Barry perfume | from lavish | high quality-long lasting"

Preferably the presence of 3 elements:

Product name

Its source (from lavish)

Attractive description (quality-stability-luxury...)

üß© Fourth: using a huge list of keywords
Add the following words to the system to randomly select a number of them in each analysis, depending on their type:

1. Words related to the fragrance itself:
Copy
Edit
Oriental fragrance, niche fragrance, women's fragrance, men's fragrance, luxury fragrance, floral fragrance, fruit fragrance, strong fragrance, high stability, top notes, luxurious composition, lasting aroma, EDP concentration
2. Marketing words:
Copy
Edit
Add to cart, shop now, discounts, offers, favorable Prices, Free Shipping, Saudi store, original perfumes, discount today, cheapest perfumes
3. Local keywords:
Copy
Edit
Perfume in Riyadh, perfume shop in Saudi Arabia, Jeddah perfumes, instant delivery, luxury perfume in Saudi Arabia, niche online perfume shop
4. Words related to comparing or replacing perfumes:
Copy
Edit
An alternative perfume, inspired by, like Baccarat Rouge, the same smell of Dior Sauvage, similar to Tom Ford, a perfume with a niche quality and a lower price
Each new analysis should select random unrepeatable words from these lists and integrate them into the description and title.

‚úÖ Fifth: improve the user interface
The ‚ÄúCopy " button for each section should always have the same name: Copy

Add a "ÿ•ÿπÿßÿØÿ© re-search" button after the results appear.

Show the product image automatically (from og:image or first <img>).

Use an easy and tidy interface as previously equipped.
